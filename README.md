# rust-docker-hello-world

A simple "hello-world" application built and run with rust through Docker.

## Disclaimer

The simple scripts you can find on this repository have been created with the purpose of automating my own workflow. With multiple little servers around, every little thing that can be automated and can save me some time is helpful. I hope this is helpful for you too.
Feel free to contact me for issues, improvement requests, etc.

## Prerequisites

I am starting to explore Rust. I wanted to create a version of the ubiquitous hello-world which would build and run under Docker.
You need to have Docker up and running on a Linux/Windows machine. This might be useful if you simply cannot install Rust on your machine, but you are allowed to use Docker.  

All of this has been tested on:

- Windows 10 with Docker Desktop

As I test the unit and/or the scripts on more platforms, I will update this list.


## Usage

Compile the application by running

`build`

Then you can run the application by running

`run`

That's basically all.
